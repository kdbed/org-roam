* Category Theory Basics
**  Category Theory and Mathematics
Category theory captures a number of essential features of mathematics. Mathematical theories often have a number of common ingredients: there are /objects/ -- numbers, sets, etc. -- and /arrows/ that provide relations among the objects.
 - a number is related to its divisors
 - functions relate sets
Furthermore, these relations can be composed.  In category theory, one has /objects/ and /arrows/, and results about these categories only make use of a single operation: composition of arrows. In this way, category theory ignores domain specific information, obtaining rich results that apply to every category.
**  Basic Definitions
Begin with the defintion of a category:

 *Definition*  : A *category* $\mathcal{C} = (O,A,\circ)$ consists of:
 1. a collection $O$ of /objects/, written $a,b,... \in O$
 2. a collection $A$ of /arrows/, written $f,g,... \in A$ between these objects, e.g., $ f: a \rightarrow b$
 3. a notion of /composition/ $f \circ g$ of arrows
 4. an identity arrow $\text{id}_a$ for each object $a \in O$

The composition operation and identity arrow should satisfy the following laws:

 - /Composition/: If $f : a \rightarrow b$ and $g : b \rightarrow c$ then $g \circ f : a \rightarrow c$.
