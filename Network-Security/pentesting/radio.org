* Software-Defined Radio and Penetration Testing
High-tech industries are increasingly depending on the Internet of Things: advanced metering infrastructures, home and building automation, personal health and fitness monitoring, etc. These technologies rely on radio communications to send and receive data.  Aside from WiFi, threats to radio communication systems have historically originated from individuals with specific knowledge and/or specific hardware.  As a result, reliably assessing the security of wireless technology is no easy task.

Nonetheless, tools to fill this void are already being developed: _RfCat_ for sub-GHz ISM radio bands, _Ubertooth_ for Bluetooth equipment, and _Api-Mote_ for ZigBee.
