* Extending Python with Rust
** Motivation
Some reasons for extending Python with a language like Rust include performance issues, as Python is incredibly slow at certain tasks; reusability, since sometimes porting code is a bother; cooperation, for not all who code do so in Python; and migration, which can be done one Python module at a time. As far as Rust is concerned, it has almost no runtime (e.g., no garbage collector), which makes it behave well in a dynamic library.

** Bindings
Two libraries providing bindings are _rust-cpython_ and _PyO3_.
